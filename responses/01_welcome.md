# Welcome!

I'm excited you're here! ðŸ‘‹

Together we're going to see how we can quickly and easily set up continuous 
code scanning using Semgrep, an open source, lightweight static analysis tool.

We'll see how Semgrep's out-of-the-box rules can find and block a broad variety of 
vulnerabilities and enforce secure guardrails (also called "paved road" or 
"secure defaults").

We'll use the awesome [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop) 
project as the repo we'll scan, and we'll use GitHub Actions to scan every Pull Request (PR).

TODO specific bullets:
* We'll cover this...
