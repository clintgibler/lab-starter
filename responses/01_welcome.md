# Welcome!

I'm excited you're here! ðŸ‘‹

Together we're going to see how we can quickly and easily set up continuous 
code scanning using Semgrep, an open source, lightweight static analysis tool.

We'll see how Semgrep's out-of-the-box rules can find and block a broad variety of 
vulnerabilities and enforce secure guardrails (also called "paved road" or 
"secure defaults").

We'll use the awesome [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop) 
project as the repo we'll scan, and we'll use GitHub Actions to scan every Pull Request (PR).

TODO specific bullets:
* We'll cover this...

## Getting Started

### Installing Semgrep

This isn't a required step, but it might be nice to have Semgrep installed locally so you can easily run scans via CLI.

TODO link to docs, have brew, pip, Docker instructions

### Slack

r2c Community Slack


Many security teams choose 

### Create Semgrep App Account

We need this for managing Semgrep in CI and choosing which rules to run, where.

Totally free for open *and* closed source repos.

Background stuff

#### Set up Slack Notification

Copy in Slack webhook URL provided by r2c into notifications. Configure policy to use those notifications.

#### Add Semgrep Token to GitHub Secrets

Grab token

Add to project Secrets tab

TODO GIF showing the process or Youtube video

We'll walk through the app later.
